        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Lumpia or Lumpiang Shanghai is a type of Filipino egg roll.</p> 
        <p>The basic filling is composed of ground pork along with minced onions, carrots,</p>
        <p> and seasonings such as salt and ground black pepper.</p> 
        <p>This lumpia recipe post is all about how to make the basic version.</p> 
        <p>Feel free to use this as a baseline.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Egg</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Chinese Celery</li>
            <li>Ground Pork</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop Ingredients</li>
                <p>I prefer to chop ingredients by hand to better control the texture. 
                Although you can totally use a food processor to mince the vegetables to save time.
                 To mince the veggies with a food processor, combine the coarsely chopped celery, carrot, and garlic together and mince them into small pieces. 
                And chop the onions separately to avoid over blending.</p>
            <li>Mix the Filling</li>
                <p>Mix the filling ingredients in a circular motion using a spatula, until the meat feels sticky, so it binds together well. 
                This makes the wrapping easier as the meat filling sticks together.</p>
            <li>Prepare the wrapping station</li>
                <p>You will need a flat surface to wrap the lumpia, a beaten egg to seal the wrappers, the filling, a tray for the wrapped lumpia, and a plate for the wrappers. 
                    I usually cover the wrappers with a few wet paper towels to prevent them from drying out.</p>
            <li>Wrap and cook Lumpia Shanghai</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Place 1 tablespoon of filling onto the lower part of the wrapper</li>
                <li>Fold the bottom edge over the filling</li>
                <li>Fold both sides of the wrapper</li>
                <li>Roll the filing over and tuck in the folded edges</li>
                <li>Roll the filling to the top and add a drop of egg wash to the top edge so you can seal the roll</li>
                <li>Place the uncooked lumpia in a zip lock bag and freeze if not using immediately</li>
                <li>To cook lumpia, deep fry them until golden brown</li>
                <li>Serve with the sweet and sour dipping sauce</li>
            </ol>
        </ol>
